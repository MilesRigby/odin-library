# odin-library
A simple library app made as part of The Odin Project

Uses a simple modal to allow adding information on books to a library, which is then displayed on cards. Books can be marked as read or unread, and deleted from the library.

Basic HTML/JS set up with an index.html file for content, styles.css for the layout, and script.js for user interaction and data storage.
